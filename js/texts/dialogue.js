        "> For instance, my number is exactly 1, and everything in our village is in the range of 0.9 ~ 1.1 . The phenomenon of things within a region having similar numbers is generally known as <b>Orders of Magnitude Effect</b> (OoM Effect).",
        "> Speaking of outside, it's far more dangerous than just plain land. The beasts in fields nearby have similar numbers with us, but if you get lost in the deep, you may encounter creatures with number 10, 100, or even higher.",
        "> With such a huge gap, even if you were just accidentally stepped on, you will be killed on the spot, without any chance to escape.",
        "> And the sea you saw, it is said that the deeper you go, the higher the OoM, and the center even reaches as high as 1e100 —— This is far more beyond our wildest imagination.",
        "> Apart from beasts, human also exist on the higher OoM, but fortunately they don't mind our little village and we can still live a relatively peaceful life.",
        "> The reason is simple: as the number rises, the resources needed to survive also rise cubically. A wolf with number 5 will have a 125 times weight, and need to eat 125 times food.",
        "> Other than food, gold is also applied to this rule. If you take 1 golden coin of our village to a town of 10 OoM, it will only have 0.001 times purchasing power. So plundering villages like ours won't do any goods.",
        "> At last, there is a more tricky point to understand —— Number will not only increase physical scale, but also slightly speed up time speed.",
        "> It is said that, human with higher number will have everything faster.—— Not because their body become bigger, but the whole life being will have faster time—— But I can't experience it myself, and I can't say exactly what that means.",
        "> ...Why would I know this?... There was a passager passing by, talked to me for a while —— he was very interested in the place at that time, says our OoM is exactly 1, which is very rare.",
        "> After he left, I thought the theory about numbers makes sense and told every villagers and children here.",
        "> The only thing I don't understand, though, is who defined <b>The standard of 1</b>. Why defined our OoM as 1, rather than 10 or 0.1 ....But I guess it's not a big deal for everyone in the village."
